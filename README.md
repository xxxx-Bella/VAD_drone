Anomaly Detection in Videos Recorded by Drones
## GAN
To verify the assumptions mentioned in the text, I experiments on *GAN* model ([Future Frame Prediction for Anomaly Detection -- A New Baseline, CVPR 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09867.pdf) by Wen Liu, Weixin Luo, Dongze Lian and Shenghua Gao).
## ANDT
I design my model based on *Vision Transformer (ViT)*, and my model is inspired by ANDT ([Anomaly Detection in Aerial Videos with Transformers, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.13363v1.pdf) by Pu Jin, Lichao Mou, Gui-Song Xia and Xiao Xiang Zhu).
